How to install:

1. Edit config.dist.php with your MySQL credentials and name it as config.php

2. Create a database called qtool, or edit config.php accordingly

3. dump dummy database (TODO EMPTY TABLES):
	mysql -u username -p -h localhost qtool < qtool.sql

4. if running from Xampp, feel free to give MySQL more resources :)
